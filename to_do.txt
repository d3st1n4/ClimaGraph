IDEAS:
    1. create a main and differentiate between the archive api call and the forcast api call depending on which start date the user inputs
    2. minimum start date is 2016-01-01, maximum end date is 2 days before current date if using forcast
    3. find out min and max dates for archive
    4. input validation, make sure all inputs are correct type
    5. make sure Adherence to PEP8 style
    6. A clear testing plan and appropriate unit tests
    7. Github Continuous Integration Automation for Style Checkers and Unit Tests
